            "One of my absolute favorite things to do is painting. The photo here shows a work in progress titled "Implosion". It is 60"x72" in size and is done in acrylic paint on canvas, that i painted a very neutral grey. The colors I chose were hues of the compliments blue and orange, blue for the body of the figure and orange for the mushroom explosion. This particular painting means a lot to me because it was a literal expression of how I was feeling at the time I created it; I was overwhelmed with all of the emotion inside of me and felt like I was on the verge of imploding. Hence the title Implosion"

         "Another thing I absolutely love to do is drawing. The drawing in the photo is a depiction of the woman I love; this is more or less an image of her alter-ego called Sara. At the time I created this we actually weren't talking at all and I missed her immensely so I drew this and posted it on my social media accounts in hopes that she would call. The funny thing is it actually worked; she knew that i did it so she would contact me but she did so anyway. This was done in Procreate, with an apple pencil on my ipad pro."

          "I really enjoy creating logos; the photo here shows a logo that I created recently and is possibly my most favorite. This is for a company called Stone & Brier, they create branding packages and design solutions for many companies across different industries. I have had the honor to work closely with them on many projects and currently maintain residence there as creative director."
