          "This was my very first web development assignment; I was tasked with
          creating a list of five different types of zoo animals and providing
          interesting facts about each. There were a few diff individual animals
          to name in each category and there were links provided to read random
          informative details about the animals characteristics and traits. As
          you can see it looks very remedial and clunky, this is by far my least
          favorite thing I've made since the wed development boot-camp began
          last month!

          "This was my second assignment from the Fullstack web development
          boot-camp; here i was tasked with creating a detailed grocery list.
          There were to be three major catagories of food items. My 3 catagories
          were: pantry items, frozen foods, and chilled or refrigerated items.
          Within each of the three main catagories there are two sub-catagories
          in which to list a few food products under. My sub-catagories were:
          canned and dry goods, vegetables and snacks, and lastly fruits and
          deli. I added a single image in each major category representing the
          items in each. For me although the html document isn't perfect, I feel
          there was an evident and visible improvement from the first to second
          assignment. Furthermore, I built a much more solid understanding and
          foundation of setting up an html document and working with css."

          "This was my third assignment from the Fullstack web development
          boot-camp and my very first time using javascript. My task was
          building a vault that requires three mathematical calculations to
          generate the three codes in a combination. I used the JavaScript
          console to create three variables. Each variable will be the result of
          each calculation (three in total). The combination of the lock is 10 -
          40 - 39. I had to use three different arithmetic operators that will
          generate each individual number, then display the combination on the
          HTML page, or in an alert popup. The photo here is a screenshot of the
          alert that comes up after opening up the webpage."
